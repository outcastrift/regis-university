Will loop through a array using a binary algorithm.  For the purpose of this example I did not place any sort of checks to keep this from infinitely looping. In a real program you would need to do so.
A example would be what if : I sent a array to the method that did not contain a value at all, this method in it's current state would infinitely loop trying to find it.
