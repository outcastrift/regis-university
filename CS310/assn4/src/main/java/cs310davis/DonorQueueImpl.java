/**
 * Created by Samuel Davis on 7/24/16.
 * You will create your own DonorQueueImpl using a singly linked list, with references to both the front
 * and back nodes in the queue (you should be able to use your DonorNode class from last week to build this
 * linked list). This implementation will be store Donor nodes, and will be used to create two separate
 * queues (representing lines waiting for tables) â€“ one for standard donors, and one for GoldStar donors.
 * .
 * <p>
 * If a donor arrives to the dinner, but there are not any tables available, the donor will be assigned to a
 * queue to wait for the next available table. If the donor is a GoldStar donor, that donor is assigned to the
 * GoldStar queue. If the donor is not, then the donor is assigned to standard donor queue.
 * Newly arriving donors will be added to the rear of the linked list.
 * When a donor is seated from the queue, that donor will be taken from the front of the linked list.
 * <p>
 * The code should be able to add and remove donors from each of the queues.
 * You will also need to build methods to check if a queue is empty or full, and use the methods.
 * If you try to remove a donor from an empty queue, you will need to provide an error message.
 * A queue will only be considered full if memory  allocation fails when you try to instantiate a new node object.
 * <p>
 * You will also need to watch for gate crashers. If a donor attempts to get a table, but his/her donor ID is
 * not in your Donor linked list (built using the code from Assn 3), then that donor will be ignored, and your
 * application will move on to the next donor.
 * <p>
 * As each action occurs, you will provide an audit trail.
 * At the end of the program, your application will provide a report providing the existing seating chart (which donor is at which table),
 * which tables are available in the stack (the top of the stack is to be listed first), and which donors are still sitting in each of
 * the queues in order.
 * All output is to be placed into a dinnerReport.txt file to be located in the output folder.
